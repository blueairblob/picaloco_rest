A.
I'll help you host your Supabase Swagger UI on Vercel. This is a great way to provide easy access to your API documentation for your Pica Loco React Native app.Let me search for more specific information about exposing Supabase's auto-generated Swagger UI.Let me search for how to access the OpenAPI spec URL from Supabase.Perfect! Now I have the key information. Let me search for how to deploy a custom Swagger UI to Vercel.Based on my research, I can now provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to host your Supabase Swagger UI on Vercel. Here's what I found:

## Hosting Supabase Swagger UI on Vercel

Great idea! Supabase automatically generates OpenAPI documentation for your database schema through PostgREST, and you can access the OpenAPI spec at `https://<project_ref>.supabase.co/rest/v1/` (note the trailing slash is required). Here's how you can host this on Vercel:

### **Step 1: Access Your Supabase OpenAPI Spec**

Your Supabase project automatically exposes an OpenAPI 2.0 specification at: `https://YOUR_PROJECT_REF.supabase.co/rest/v1/?apikey=YOUR_ANON_KEY`

### **Step 2: Create a Custom Swagger UI Project**

Create a new project structure for hosting on Vercel:### **Step 3: Environment Setup**

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:### **Step 4: Deploy to Vercel**

1. **Push to GitHub**: Create a repository and push your code
2. **Import to Vercel**: 
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - In Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### **Step 5: Advanced Configuration** 

For a more robust setup, you can also create a custom HTML page:### **Benefits of This Setup**

1. **Automatic Updates**: The documentation automatically updates as you make database changes in Supabase
2. **Interactive Testing**: Users can test API endpoints directly from the documentation
3. **Custom Branding**: Styled to match your Pica Loco brand
4. **Secure**: API keys are handled through environment variables
5. **Free Hosting**: Vercel's hobby plan supports this perfectly

### **Important Notes**

- Supabase currently provides OpenAPI 2.0 specs. If you need 3.0+, you'll need to convert them using tools like swagger-editor
- The documentation will include all your database tables, views, and RPC functions
- Make sure to keep your `service_role` key secure and only use `anon` key for public documentation
- Consider using Supabase's Vercel integration for seamless environment variable management

### **Alternative: Static HTML Deployment**

If you prefer a simpler static approach, you can just use the HTML file in the artifact above and deploy it as a static site on Vercel, replacing the placeholder URLs with your actual Supabase credentials.

This setup will give you a professional, branded API documentation site for your Pica Loco React Native app that's automatically synced with your Supabase schema!
